I have created this project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. So you'll need to run it on a local server. Before running it, place the project folder inside the htdocs folder of your XAMPP directory. Then, start your XAMPP server and access the project from there â€” you'll be able to use it easily.
